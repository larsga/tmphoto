tmphoto is a web-based photo gallery application. It's based on Topic Maps, and requires the [Ontopia](http://www.ontopia.net) Topic Maps engine to work. The software already runs [my personal gallery](http://www.garshol.priv.no/tmphoto/). See the [getting started page](http://code.google.com/p/tmphoto/wiki/GettingStarted) for more information.

Topic maps created using tmphoto can be browsed using [the Topic Maps File System](http://code.google.com/p/mappa/source/browse/tmfs).

The application was written by [Lars Marius Garshol](http://www.garshol.priv.no). If you have questions you can just email him.
