#summary How to set up the database.

= Introduction =

In order to have access to voting and comments on photos you need to set up a database. At the moment, only PostgreSQL is supported. Create a database in PostgreSQL (say, tmphoto), then [http://code.google.com/p/tmphoto/source/browse/trunk/doc/createdb.sql run the SQL to create the tables].

The next step is to go into web.xml and set up the following parameters:

||*Property*||*Value*||
||jdbcurl||jdbc:postgresql:tmphoto||
||jdbcuser||postgres user name||
||jdbcpasswd||postgres password||

Finally, you have to put the PostgreSQL JDBC driver .jar file into tmphoto/WEB-INF/lib.
